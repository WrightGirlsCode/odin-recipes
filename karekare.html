    <h2>What's Kare-Kare?</h2>
    <p>Kare-Kare is a rich Filipino stew made with a savory peanut sauce. It's
        usually made with oxtail, but beef chuck, shank, pork shank, pork hock (aka Pata
        Kare-Kare) are all very popular choices of meat. The thick and tasty peanut sauce complements the tender oxtail,
        and this meal is usually accompanied
        by white rice and bagoong. (a fermented shrimp paste)</p>
    <p>There are three steps to this process: Tenderizing the meat, making the sauce,
        and preparing the vegetables. We tenderize the meat by boiling it with chopped onion,
        which will take 3 hours (give yourself time beforehand!) since oxtail needs to be <em>very</em>
        tender for ultimate flavor. A quicker way is also by using a pressure cooker.

    <p>Peanut sauce tips: Using peanut butter <em>and</em> crushed peanuts makes a richer flavor,
        and soaking annatto seeds in warm water, then using the water gives it that
        reddish color for the sauce. Finally, just a tip for the vegetables: Sauteeing them in garlic
        before adding to the meat is a great way to enhance their own flavor, so they don't blend into the background
        once in the stew.</p>
