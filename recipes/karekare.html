    <!-- Description -->
    <h2>What's Kare-Kare?</h2>
    <p>Kare-Kare is a rich Filipino stew made with a savory peanut sauce. It's
        usually made with oxtail, but beef chuck, shank, pork shank, pork hock (aka Pata
        Kare-Kare) are all very popular choices of meat. The thick and tasty peanut sauce complements the tender oxtail,
        and this meal is usually accompanied
        by white rice and bagoong. (a fermented shrimp paste)</p>
    <p>There are three steps to this process: Tenderizing the meat, making the sauce,
        and preparing the vegetables. Tenderize the meat by boiling it with chopped onion in a
        pressure cooker, which takes about 30 minutes.(3 hours otherwise for oxtail) Make sure
        you have enough water poured in, so the meat is fully tenderized.
    </p>

    <p>The bagoong (shrimp paste) is an essential addition to this dish, so make sure it's fully cooked
        before serving. Another tip is using toasted ground rice to thicken the sauce. (Cornstarch or potato
        starch are good alternatives!)
    </p>
    <p>Peanut sauce tips: Using peanut butter <em>and</em> crushed peanuts makes a richer flavor,
        and soaking annatto seeds in warm water, then using the water gives it that
        reddish color for the sauce. (More convenient alternatives are annatto powder/paste) Finally, just a tip for the
        vegetables: Sauteeing them in garlic
        before adding to the meat is a great way to enhance their own flavor, so they don't blend into the background
        once in the stew.</p>
