    <!-- Description -->
    <h2>What's Kare-Kare?</h2>
    <p>Kare-Kare is a rich Filipino stew made with a savory peanut sauce. It's
        usually made with oxtail, but beef chuck/shank, pork shank/hock (aka Pata
        Kare-Kare) are all very popular choices of meat. This meal is usually paired
        with white rice and bagoong. (a fermented shrimp paste, which should be fully cooked before serving)
    </p>

    <p>There are three steps to this process: Tenderizing the meat, making the sauce,
        and preparing the vegetables. When boiling the meat, be sure to have pour enough water in, so it's fully
        tenderized.
    </p>

    <p>Peanut sauce tips: Using peanut butter <em>and</em> crushed peanuts makes a richer flavor,
        and soaking annatto seeds in warm water, then using the water gives it that
        reddish color for the sauce. (More convenient alternatives are annatto powder/paste) Toasted ground rice is used
        to thicken the sauce, but cornstarch/potato starch are good
        alternatives.
    </p>
    </p>Finally, just a tip for the
    vegetables: Sautee them in garlic <em>before</em> adding to the meat, so their flavor doesn't get lost in the stew.
