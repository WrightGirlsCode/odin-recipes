    <h1>Lemon Poppy Seed Torte</h1>
    <img src="" alt="" />

    <!-- description of recipe-->
    <p>This is a traditional Ukrainian torte, made even better with a tart rasberry curd filling,
        and a white chocolate whipped cream frosting. (frosting should be made day before for best texture) This torte
        is a tad bit heavier than poppy seed bakes you usually
        see, and the honey in the recipe gives it a distinct flavor and a richer texture. Now that I've introduced you
        to
        this Ukrainian delight, let's get stuck in!
