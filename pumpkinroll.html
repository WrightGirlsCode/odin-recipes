    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This pumpkin roll recipe is a pinwheel-like dessert, best served chilled, made of spiced pumpkin cake with
        spirals of cream cheese filling inside. This may seem like a complicated
        bake, but rest assured it's much easier than you think! There are only two ground rules, be <i>very</i> gentle
        while rolling, and watch the cooking time. Keeping the cake moist and springy is key to successful, uncracked
        spirals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's a few simple tips before we start: Your cream cheese frosting should be a bit stiff, so it doesn't
        squeeze out when you roll the cake out, but too much stiffness can tear the cake as you spread the frosting
        on. Sounds tricky, but just remember the principle: We want to be able to safely roll the cake around
        the frosting, without any cracks or runaway frosting. Let's begin!

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <!-- directions for making roll-->

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°. Line a 15" x 10" jelly roll pan with parchment, then grease pan with cooking spray.
            In a large bowl, combine sugar, flour, salt, baking soda, pumpkin spice, eggs, and pumpkin puree until
            <em>just</em> combined.
            Spread into prepared pan and bake for about 15 mins. Insert a toothpick into center of cake, and if it comes
            out clean, it's done!
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>While cake is baking, lay out a large kitchen towel on a clean, flat countertop & dust with powdered sugar.
            When cake is done baking,
            quickly flip onto kitchen towel and slowly peel off parchment paper. (Remember, theres no rush! We don't
            want to take any bits of cake
            off with the paper.)
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Starting at a short end, gently (but tightly) roll cake into a log. Let it cool completely. </li>
        <br />
        <li>Meanwhile, let's start on the filling: In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, melted butter, vanilla,
            powdered sugar, and salt. Using a
            hand mixer, whip until you have a smooth consistency.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>When cake is finished cooling, gently unroll. (It's ok if it's still slightly curled. Trying to flatten it
            too much may cause breaks.)
            Spread with cream cheese filling, gently roll back up, and dust with powdered sugar. Slice and serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
